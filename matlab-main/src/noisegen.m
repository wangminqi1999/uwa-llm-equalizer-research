function w = noisegen(input_size, fs, varargin)
% NOISEGEN Generate underwater acoustic noise.
%
% W = NOISEGEN(INPUT_SIZE, FS) generates independent pink Gaussian
% noise with 17 dB / decade power spectrum, W. INPUT_SIZE specifies the
% size of the input signal, and FS is the sampling rate of the input signal.
% The noise is assumed to be spatially independent.
%
% W = NOISEGEN(INPUT_SIZE, FS, ARRAY_INDEX, NOISE) generates acoustic
% noise using the mixing-coefficient method. The noise struct determines
% the distribution:
%   alpha == 2  => Gaussian (stabrnd reduces to Box-Muller).
%   alpha <  2  => Symmetric alpha-stable (impulsive).
%
% The NOISE struct contains the following fields:
%   Fs        - Sampling rate at which noise statistics were measured [Hz].
%   R         - Signal bandwidth [Hz].
%   alpha     - Stability index of the S-alpha-S distribution (2 = Gaussian).
%   beta      - Mixing coefficients, size [M x M x K].
%   fc        - Center frequency [Hz].
%   rms_power - Per-channel RMS (std) of the unscaled mixed+bandpassed noise,
%               size [M x 1]. Generation divides by this so each output
%               channel has unit power and the summed power equals M.
%   version   - Noise struct version (>= 1.0).
%
% ARRAY_INDEX specifies the indices of the receiver elements through which
% the user would like to generate noise. These indices must match those
% used in the REPLAY function.
%
% Inputs:
%    input_size              - Input signal matrix size.
%    fs                      - Sampling rate of the input signal in Hz.
%    array_index             - Indices of the channels.
%    noise                   - Struct containing noise statistics.
%
% Outputs:
%    w                       - Generated noise.

% STABRND Stable Random Number Generator
% (McCulloch 12/18/96)
%
% x = stabrnd(alpha,beta,c,delta,m,n);
%
% alpha, beta, c and delta are the characteristic exponent,
%   symmetry paramter, scale parameter (dispersion^1/alpha) and
%   location parameter respectively.
%
% Returns m x n matrix of iid stable random numbers with
%   characteristic exponent alpha in [.1,2], skewness parameter
%   beta in [-1,1], scale c > 0, and location parameter delta.
%
% Based on the method of J.M. Chambers, C.L. Mallows and B.W.
%   Stuck, "A Method for Simulating Stable Random Variables,"
%   JASA 71 (1976): 340-4.
%
% Encoded in MATLAB by J. Huston McCulloch, Ohio State
%   University Econ. Dept. (mcculloch.2@osu.edu).  This 12/18/96
%   version uses 2*m*n calls to RAND, and does not rely on
%   the STATISTICS toolbox.

% The CMS method is applied in such a way that x will have the
%   log characteristic function
%        log E exp(ixt) = i*delta*t + psi(c*t),
%   where
%     psi(t) = -abs(t)^alpha*(1-i*beta*sign(t)*tan(pi*alpha/2))
%                              for alpha ~= 1,
%            = -abs(t)*(1+i*beta*(2/pi)*sign(t)*log(abs(t))),
%                              for alpha = 1.
%
% With this parameterization, the stable cdf S(x; alpha, beta,
%   c, delta) equals S((x-delta)/c; alpha, beta, 1, 0).  See my
%   "On the parametrization of the afocal stable distributions,"
%   _Bull. London Math. Soc._ 28 (1996): 651-55, for details.
%
% When alpha = 2, the distribution is Gaussian with mean delta
%   and variance 2*c^2, and beta has no effect.
%
% When alpha > 1, the mean is delta for all beta.  When alpha
%   <= 1, the mean is undefined.
%
% When beta = 0, the distribution is symmetrical and delta is
%   the median for all alpha.  When alpha = 1 and beta = 0, the
%   distribution is Cauchy (arctangent) with median delta.
%
% When the submitted alpha is > 2 or < .1, or beta is outside
%   [-1,1], an error message is generated and x is returned as a
%   matrix of NaNs.
%
% Alpha < .1 is not allowed here because of the non-negligible
%   probability of overflows.
%
% If you're only interested in the symmetric cases, you may just
%   set beta = 0 and skip the following considerations:
%
% When beta > 0 (< 0), the distribution is skewed to the right
%   (left).
%
% When alpha < 1, delta, as defined above, is the unique fractile
%   that is invariant under averaging of iid contributions.  I
%   call such a fractile a "focus of stability."  This, like the
%   mean, is a natural location parameter.
%
% When alpha = 1, either every fractile is a focus of stability,
%   as in the beta = 0 Cauchy case, or else there is no focus of
%   stability at all, as is the case for beta ~=0.  In the latter
%   cases, which I call "afocal," delta is just an arbitrary
%   fractile that has a simple relation to the c.f.
%
% When alpha > 1 and beta > 0, med(x) must lie very far below
%   the mean as alpha approaches 1 from above.  Furthermore, as
%   alpha approaches 1 from below, med(x) must lie very far above
%   the focus of stability when beta > 0.  If beta ~= 0, there
%   is therefore a discontinuity in the distribution as a function
%   of alpha as alpha passes 1, when delta is held constant.
%
% CMS, following an insight of Vladimir Zolotarev, remove this
%   discontinuity by subtracting
%          beta*c*tan(pi*alpha/2)
%   (equivalent to their -tan(alpha*phi0)) from x for alpha ~=1
%   in their program RSTAB, a.k.a. RNSTA in IMSL (formerly GGSTA).
%   The result is a random number whose distribution is a contin-
%   uous function of alpha, but whose location parameter (which I
%   call zeta) is a shifted version of delta that has no known
%   interpretation other than computational convenience.
%   The present program restores the more meaningful "delta"
%   parameterization by using the CMS (4.1), but with
%   beta*c*tan(pi*alpha/2) added back in (ie with their initial
%   tan(alpha*phi0) deleted).  RNSTA therefore gives different
%   results than the present program when beta ~= 0.  However,
%   the present beta is equivalent to the CMS beta' (BPRIME).
%
% Rather than using the CMS D2 and exp2 functions to compensate
%   for the ill-condition of the CMS (4.1) when alpha is very
%   near 1, the present program merely fudges these cases by
%   computing x from their (2.4) and adjusting for
%   beta*c*tan(pi*alpha/2) when alpha is within 1.e-8 of 1.
%   This should make no difference for simulation results with
%   samples of size less than approximately 10^8, and then
%   only when the desired alpha is within 1.e-8 of 1, but not
%   equal to 1.
%
% The frequently used Gaussian and symmetric cases are coded
%   separately so as to speed up execution.
